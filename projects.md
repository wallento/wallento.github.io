# Wasm4IoT

Wasm4IoT is an internal project of multiple components and aspects of IoT
deployments based on WebAssembly modules. We will publish our work on Github
soon along with some documentation and publications.

# RISC-V Simulator for Visual Studio Code

Based on the popular Venus RISC-V simulator, we have built an extension for
Visual Studio code. It allows the user to write RISC-V assembly and directly run
and debug the code without further tools needed. The extension also provides
visual components for a better learning experience, such as an LED matrix or a
virtual PCB with LEDs and push buttons.
